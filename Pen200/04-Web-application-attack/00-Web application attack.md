Enumeration of new functionality is important each step of the way especially since attacks that previously failed may succeed in a new context. As penetration testers, we must continue to enumerate and adapt until we’ve exhausted all attack avenues or compromised the system.

Web Application Enumeration:

It is important to identify the components that make up a web application before attempting to blindly exploit it. Many web application vulnerabilities are technology-agnostic. However, some exploits and payloads need to be crafted based on the technological underpinnings of the application, such as the database software or operating system. Before launching any attacks on a web application, we should attempt to discover the technology stack in use, which generally consists of the following components:

• Programming language and frameworks 
• Web server software 
• Database software 
• Server operating system
