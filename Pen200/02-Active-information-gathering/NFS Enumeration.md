Network File System (NFS)213 is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun
Microsystems in 1984. It allows a user on a client computer to access files over a computer
network as if they were on locally-mounted storage.

NFS is often used with UNIX operating systems and is predominantly insecure in its
implementation. It can be somewhat difficult to set up securely, so itâ€™s not uncommon to find NFS
shares open to the world. This is quite convenient for us as penetration testers, as we might be
able to leverage them to collect sensitive information, escalate our privileges, and so forth.
