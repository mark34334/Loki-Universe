The SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) is a database containing information usually
related to network management. The database is organized like a tree, where branches represent
different organizations or network functions. The leaves of the tree (final endpoints) correspond
to specific variable values that can then be accessed, and probed, by an external user. The IBM
Knowledge Center217 contains a wealth of information about the MIB tree.

For example, the following MIB values correspond to specific Microsoft Windows SNMP
parameters and contains much more than network-based information:
		
		1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.6.0 System Processes
		
		1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2 Running Programs

		1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.4 Processes Path

		1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.4 Storage Units

		1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2 Software Name

		1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25 User Accounts

		1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3 TCP Local Ports
