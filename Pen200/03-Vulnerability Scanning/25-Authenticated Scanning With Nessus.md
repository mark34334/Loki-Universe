Keep in mind however that as penetration testers we would not perform an authenticated scan in most cases without explicit permission and clear communication from the target network administrators due to potentially higher risks of unintentional interruptions to production systems.

Even though all Nessus templates accept user credentials, we will use the Credentialed Patch
Audit scan template, which comes preconfigured to execute local security checks against the
target. This template will not only scan for missing operating system level patches, but will also
scan for outdated applications that could be vulnerable to vectors such as privilege escalation.

Next, we click the Credentials tab and the SSH category. On the Authentication method dropdown, we select password, set the username to “root”, and provide the password for our Debian client.
