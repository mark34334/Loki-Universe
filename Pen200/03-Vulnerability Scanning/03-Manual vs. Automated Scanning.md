A manual review of a remote target network will inevitably be very resource-intensive and time-
consuming. Since this approach relies heavily on human interaction and repetitive tasks, it is also prone to errors in which vulnerabilities may be overlooked. Nevertheless, red-teaming in particular, requires surgical precision and a minimal network footprint in order to remain undetected as long as possible. Using an automated scanner in these types of situations would
not be the best approach. Furthermore, manual analysis allows for discovery of complex and
logical vulnerabilities that are rather difficult to discover using any type of automated scanner.

Automated vulnerability scanners are invaluable when working on large engagements
under the typical time constraints associated with traditional security assessments. Whether
using a general scanner across the entire target network or against a single dedicated host, we
can establish a baseline in a much shorter period of time. These baselines allow us to validate
easily-detected vulnerabilities, or at the very least help us understand the general security posture
of the target.
