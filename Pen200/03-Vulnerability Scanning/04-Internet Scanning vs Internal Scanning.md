Vulnerability scanners can easily scan Internet-connected targets as well as those connected to a
local network. However, our scan results may be incomplete or inaccurate if we treat these
targets as equals. Our network placement in relation to the target can affect our speed threshold,
access rights, likelihood of traffic interference, and target visibility.

The speed of our connection to the target network dictates not only the raw bandwidth available
to our scanner, but other factors such as the number of hops to the individual hosts. This means
that we can conduct more intrusive and comprehensive scans more quickly against locally-
connected hosts. However, we must be mindful of our traffic at all times, realizing that older
equipment may be adversely affected by heavy scans. For optimal results, consider the guidelines
established in the port scanning discussion in previous modules.
