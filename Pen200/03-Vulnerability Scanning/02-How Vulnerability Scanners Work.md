Vulnerability scanner implementations vary, but generally follow a standard workflow. Most
automated scanners will:
	1. Detect if a target is up and running.
	2.Conduct a full or partial port scan, depending on the configuration.
	3.Identify the operating system using common fingerprinting techniques.
	4.Attempt to identify running services with common techniques such as banner grabbing service behavior identification, or file discovery.
	5.Execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilities.
