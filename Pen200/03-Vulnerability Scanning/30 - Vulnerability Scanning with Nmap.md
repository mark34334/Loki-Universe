we can also use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to perform automated vulnerability scans. While NSE is not a full-fledged vulnerability scanner, it does have a respectable library of scripts that can be used to detect and validate vulnerabilities. NSE scripts are written in Lua236 and range in functionality from brute force and authentication to detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities. For these purposes we will focus on the scripts in the “vuln” and “exploit” categories, as the former detects a vulnerability and the latter attempts to exploit it.

there is overlap between these categories and some “vuln” scripts may essentially run
stripped-down exploits. For this reason, scripts are also further categorized as “safe” or “intrusive”
and we should take great care when executing the latter because they may crash a remote
service or take down the target.

		`/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory`

		`cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/`

We will use --script vuln to run all scripts in the “vuln” category against a target in the PWK labs

		`sudo nmap --script vuln 10.11.1.10`
