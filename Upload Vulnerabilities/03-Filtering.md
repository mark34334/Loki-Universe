Up until now we have largely been ignoring the counter\-defences employed by web developers to defend against file upload vulnerabilities. Every website that you've successfully attacked so far in this room has been completely insecure. It's time that changed. From here on out, we'll be looking at some of the defence mechanisms used to prevent malicious file uploads, and how to circumvent them.

---

First up, let's discuss the differences between *client*\-side filtering and *server*\-side filtering.

When we talk about a script being "Client\-Side", in the context of web applications, we mean that it's running in the user's browser as opposed to on the web server itself. JavaScript is pretty much ubiquitous as the client\-side scripting language, although alternatives do exist.Â  Regardless of the language being used, a client\-side script will be run in your web browser. In the context of file\-uploads, this means that the filtering occurs before the file is even uploaded to the server. Theoretically, this would seem like a good thing, right? In an ideal world, it would be; however, because the filtering is happening on *our* computer, it is trivially easy to bypass. As such client\-side filtering by itself is a highly insecure method of verifying that an uploaded file is not malicious.

Conversely, as you may have guessed, a *server*\-side script will be run on the server. Traditionally PHP was the predominant server\-side language (with Microsoft's ASP for IIS coming in close second); however, in recent years, other options (C#, Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, and a variety of others) have become more widely used. Server\-side filtering tends to be more difficult to bypass, as you don't have the code in front of you. As the code is executed on the server, in most cases it will also be impossible to bypass the filter completely; instead we have to form a payload which conforms to the filters in place, but still allows us to execute our code.

With that in mind, let's take a look at some different kinds of filtering.

*Extension Validation:*

File extensions are used (in theory) to identify the contents of a file. In practice they are very easy to change, so actually don't mean much; however, MS Windows still uses them to identify file types, although Unix based systems tend to rely on other methods, which we'll cover in a bit. Filters that check for extensions work in one of two ways. They either *blacklist* extensions (i.e. have a list of extensions which are **not** allowed) or they *whitelist* extensions (i.e. have a list of extensions which **are** allowed, and reject everything else).

*File Type Filtering:*

Similar to Extension validation, but more intensive, file type filtering looks, once again, to verify that the contents of a file are acceptable to upload. We'll be looking at two types of file type validation:

*   *MIME validation:* MIME (**M**ultipurpose **I**nternet **M**ail **E**xtension) types are used as an identifier for files \-\- originally when transfered as attachments over email, but now also when files are being transferred over HTTP(S). The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the header of the request, and looks something like this:

    MIME types follow the format /. In the request above, you can see that the image "spaniel.jpg" was uploaded to the server. As a legitimate JPEG image, the MIME type for this upload was "image/jpeg". The MIME type for a file can be checked client\-side and/or server\-side; however, as MIME is based on the extension of the file, this is extremely easy to bypass.

*   *Magic Number validation**:*** Magic numbers are the more accurate way of determining the contents of a file; although, they are by no means impossible to fake. The "magic number" of a file is a string of bytes at the very beginning of the file content which identify the content. For example, a PNG file would have these bytes at the very top of the file: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`.

    Unlike Windows, Unix systems use magic numbers for identifying files; however, when dealing with file uploads, it is possible to check the magic number of the uploaded file to ensure that it is safe to accept. This is by no means a guaranteed solution, but it's more effective than checking the extension of a file.

*File Length Filtering:*

File length filters are used to prevent huge files from being uploaded to the server via an upload form (as this can potentially starve the server of resources). In most cases this will not cause us any issues when we upload shells; however, it's worth bearing in mind that if an upload form only expects a very small file to be uploaded, there may be a length filter in place to ensure that the file length requirement is adhered to. As an example, our fully fledged PHP reverse shell from the previous task is 5.4Kb big \-\- relatively tiny, but if the form expects a maximum of 2Kb then we would need to find an alternative shell to upload.

*File Name Filtering:*

As touched upon previously, files uploaded to a server should be unique. Usually this would mean adding a random aspect to the file name, however, an alternative strategy would be to check if a file with the same name already exists on the server, and give the user an error if so. Additionally, file names should be sanitised on upload to ensure that they don't contain any "bad characters", which could potentially cause problems on the file system when uploaded (e.g. null bytes or forward slashes on Linux, as well as control characters such as `;` and potentially unicode characters). What this means for us is that, on a well administered system, our uploaded files are unlikely to have the same name we gave them before uploading, so be aware that you may have to go hunting for your shell in the event that you manage to bypass the content filtering.

*File Content Filtering:*

More complicated filtering systems may scan the full contents of an uploaded file to ensure that it's not spoofing its extension, MIME type and Magic Number. This is a significantly more complex process than the majority of basic filtration systems employ, and thus will not be covered in this room.

It's worth noting that none of these filters are perfect by themselves \-\- they will usually be used in conjunction with each other, providing a multi\-layered filter, thus increasing the security of the upload significantly. Any of these filters can all be applied client\-side, server\-side, or both.

Similarly, different frameworks and languages come with their own inherent methods of filtering and validating uploaded files. As a result, it is possible for language specific exploits to appear; for example, until PHP major version five, it was possible to bypass an extension filter by appending a null byte, followed by a valid extension, to the malicious `.php` file. More recently it was also possible to inject PHP code into the exif data of an otherwise valid image file, then force the server to execute it. These are things that you are welcome to research further, should you be interested.
